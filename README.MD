# Predicting the severity of obstructive sleep apnea based on paranasal sinus computed tomography scan using multimodal deep learning models

Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder that can lead to serious health problems if left untreated. Paranasal sinus computed tomography (CT) scans have shown promise in predicting OSA severity, but manual interpretation is time-consuming and error-prone. 

This project implements multimodal deep learning models to predict the severity of OSA based on paranasal sinus CT scans. The models take both structured and unstructured data as inputs, and are trained and tested using the provided dataset.
